# GoConnect
An application that acts as a system to break the convenience of texting and keeping in touch through social media, and encourages people to connect through more "real ways" (video calls, phone calls, physical meet-ups, etc.). The app will have an algorithm in place that rewards users with virtual coins based on their activity that can be redeemed in a virtual shop for goods and services.
